# intro

## nodejs pros

1. single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model
2. perfect for building **fast** and **scalable** (可扩展) data-intensive (数据密集) apps
3. **JavaScript across the entire stack**: faster and more efficient development
4. **NPM**: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free
5. **very active** developer community

## use nodejs

1. API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL (非关系型), like MongoDB)
2. data streaming (think YouTube)
3. real-time chat application
4. server-side web application

## don't use

application with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive)
eg. 图像处理，视频转换，文件压缩等
